## How to run:
Download as zip, unzip and run the executable file My_First_RPG.exe from Build folder.
Scripts folder is unnecessary to run the program, it is only for those who are interested in this code information.

# IMPORTANT❗❗❗
## Instructions / tutorial:
* I haven't created the menus yet so the game starts automatically and you will need alt-f4 to exit💀.
* Right click to move and attack 🤺.
* You need a sword to pass to the second screen, look for it 🔎.
* When you get more than one weapon you can switch back to Sword with Q, Bow with W and Fireball with E 🔥.


## Have fun. I will update the game little by little.
### 🚧 Work in progress includes:
* Life bars and damage data 📊
* Improved menus and inventory 📜
* Immersive dialogues 🗣️
* Intriguing quests 🗺️
* Immersive sounds 🔊
