# How to run:
Download as zip, unzip and run the executable file My_First_RPG.exe from Build folder 

## Important!
# Instructions / tutorial:

* I haven't created the menus yet so the game starts automatically and you will need alt-f4 to exit.
* Right click to move and attack.
* You need a sword to pass to the second screen, look for it.
* When you get more than one weapon you can switch back to Sword with Q, Bow with W and Fireball with E.
